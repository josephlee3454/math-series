*  Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)
* Similar to the Fibonacci numbers, each Lucas number is defined to be the sum of its two immediate previous terms, thereby forming a Fibonacci integer sequence. The first two Lucas numbers are L0 = 2 and L1 = 1 as opposed to the first two Fibonacci numbers F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_number)



# feature tasks 
#### [x] Create a function called "fibo_nth". This function should have one parameter "n".
#### [x] The function should return the nth value in the fibonacci series.
#### [x] Create a function called "lucas_nth".
#### [x] The function should return the nth value in the lucas numbers.
#### [x] Create a function called "sum_series". With one required parameter and two optional parameters.
#### [x] Required parameter will determine which element in the series to print.
#### [x] Two optional parameters(a,b) will have default values of 0 and 1 and will determine the first two values for the series to be produced.
#### [x] Calling this function with no optional a and b parameters will produce numbers form the fibonacci series.
#### [x] Calling this function with optional arguments will produce other series.
#### [x] Ensure that your function(s) has a well-formed docstrings
